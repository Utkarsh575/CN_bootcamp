Password Generator:
this is a random password generator made using python and numpy that generates passwords based upon the words entered by the user

Spin the Yarn:
The program first prompts the user to enter a series of inputs. These can be an
adjective, a preposition, a proper noun, etc. Once all the inputs are in place, they are placed in a premade story template
using concatenation. In the end, the full story is printed out to read some mis
intended madness!
